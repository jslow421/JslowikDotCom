# Me
 
Hey there!

I'm John, a software developer in the SE Wisconsin area. Currently, I'm working for Navitus Health Solutions. When I'm not at my computer (which admittedly is rarely) I enjoy watching movies and tinkering with electronics. I'm a lifelong Minnesota sports fan, so I'm excellent at handling disappointment. Also, I'm a big fan of Open Source Software, so if you happen to have info on a project looking for help, please let me know!
