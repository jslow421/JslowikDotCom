# Me

Hey there!

I'm John, a software developer in the SE Wisconsin area. I've also earned my AWS Certified Solutions Architect -
Associate certification. Currently, I'm working for Caylent as a cloud native applications software engineer. When I'm not at my computer 
(which admittedly is rarely) I enjoy watching
movies and tinkering with electronics. I'm a lifelong Minnesota sports fan, so I'm excellent at handling disappointment.
Also, I'm a big fan of Open Source Software, so if you happen to have info on a project looking for help, please let me
know!
