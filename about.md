# Me

Hey there!

I'm John, a software developer in the SE Wisconsin area. I've earned my AWS Certified Solutions Architect -
Associate certification and am in the process of studying for my Professional. Currently, I'm working for Caylent as a cloud native applications software engineer. When I'm not at my computer 
(which admittedly is rarely) I enjoy watching
movies and tinkering with electronics. I'm a lifelong Minnesota sports fan, so I'm excellent at handling disappointment. 
I'm a big fan of Open Source Software, and am working on becoming a better contributor.
